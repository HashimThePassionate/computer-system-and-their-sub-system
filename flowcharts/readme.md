# 💻 Understanding Computer Programs and Flowcharts

## 🖥️ **What is a Computer Program?**

A **computer program** is basically a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. These instructions are written in a specific computer language. Imagine giving someone step-by-step directions to complete a task—this is similar to what a program does for a computer.

For example, if you want the computer to calculate the average of three numbers, you would write a series of instructions:
1. 📝 Get the three numbers.
2. ➕ Add the numbers together.
3. ➗ Divide the sum by three to find the average.

These steps will usually happen one after the other unless you tell the computer to do something different.

The main goal of programming is to solve problems using computers quickly and accurately. 🏃‍♂️💡

### 🗂️ **What is a Flowchart and Algorithm?**

When you have a problem and need a solution, you can use a series of steps involving calculations or logic to get the desired result. This sequence of steps is called an **algorithm**. 🧠

However, just reading a list of steps (an algorithm) can be confusing. That’s where a **flowchart** comes in handy. A flowchart is a diagram that represents the steps of an algorithm visually, using different shapes to show different types of actions or steps. 📊

For example, if you want to send a message to a friend, there are different ways to do it:
1. 📞 Call them on the phone.
2. 📬 Send them a letter by post.
3. 📦 Use a courier service.

Depending on the urgency, you might choose the fastest or the most cost-effective way. The best way to solve the problem, considering time and resources, is called the **optimum way**. 🚀

## 🔄 **Types of Flowcharts**

There are two main types of flowcharts:
1. **Program Flowchart**: This is a step-by-step representation of a single task or program. 🛠️
2. **System Flowchart**: This represents multiple related tasks or programs that work together to achieve a common goal. 🎯

**Program Flowcharts** are especially helpful in program development because:
- ✅ They help in spotting errors easily.
- ⏩ They make it easier and faster to follow the program's logic.
- 📜 They act as a documentation tool, useful for future program modifications.

### 📋 **Rules for Creating a Program Flowchart:**
- ✏️ Use only standard symbols.
- 🔝 The flow should go from top to bottom and left to right.
- 🚪 Each symbol should have one entry and one exit point (except the decision symbol).
- 💬 The operations inside a symbol should be written in a way that is not specific to any programming language.
- 🔖 Label all decision branches clearly.
